# snps-count
17.05.2022
Python script developed to be used for bachelor thesis on SNPs analysis

Input files are ".snp" formatted files from UGENE "Export consensus variations" operation.

Script is written to count the SNPs based on what they represent:
  - Purine/Purine Substitution
  - Pyrimidine/Pyrimidine Substitution
  - Purine/Pyrimidine Substitution
  - Pyrimidine/Purine Substitution

If there is a need to choose the file to be analysed, you can always change the path to the file in code.
